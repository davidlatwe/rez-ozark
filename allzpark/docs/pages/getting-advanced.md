### Getting Advanced

So you've taken Allzpark for a spin and found that it is wonderful, good for you! Here's how you can take it to the next level, by learning about how Allzpark and Rez works in a shared environment.

<br>

### Performance pt. 1

- [ ] Memcached and why you need it
- [ ] Memcached configuration recommendations

!!! note "Work in progress"
	[Let me know](https://github.com/mottosso/allzpark/issues) if you would like me to flesh out this section, or if you are already familiar with Rez and `memcached`, help out by [contributing to the project](/contributing).

<br>

### Performance pt. 2

- [ ] Packages are folders on your filesystem, your filesystem is slow
- [ ] Localisation and remote labour

!!! note "Work in progress"
	[Let me know](https://github.com/mottosso/allzpark/issues) if you would like me to flesh out this section.

<br>

### Releasing Packages

- [ ] Shared package repository
- [ ] Read/write permissions
- [ ] Automatic relase via GitLab CI

!!! note "Work in progress"
	[Let me know](https://github.com/mottosso/allzpark/issues) if you would like me to flesh out this section, or if you are already familiar with Rez and `rez release` or `rez build --prefix`, help out by [contributing to the project](/contributing).

<br>

### Rezifying Allzpark

Learn how to close the loop and make Allzpark into just another Rez package.

<br>

### Rezifying Rez

Turn the loop into a spiral by making Rez another shared package. Key point here being, how can you keep everyone on the same version of Rez, if Rez is the thing keeping everyone at the same version of software?

- [ ] Rez is just another Python package, can reside anywhere
- [ ] So can Python
- [ ] Only thing to keep in mind is performance; on Windows more of an issue, on Linux not so much

### Beta Package

Learn about how to release packages to a smaller test audience without disrupting normal operation, with the `.beta` suffix.

<br>

### Package Encapsulation

Learn about the importance and utility of keeping packages self-contained and not reference anything outside of its own root directory.
